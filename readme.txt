This should be a new and improved website.

Requirements:
	- Information about time, location, topics, etc
	- Something pleasing to look at when you first open the website
	- Sign up link
	- Sponsorship credits
	- FAQ:
		What is a hackathon?
		How much does it cost?
		Do I need to know how to code?
		Will there be free merch?
		How many people can be on a team?
		Who can attend?
	- Schedule with some cool javascript or something
	- Logo
	- Past projects
	- "Our team" section

Goals:
	- Attract possible participants
	- Easy sign-up link for people coming from social media
	- Provide a professional-looking site for sponsors to drool over

Separate stuff:
	- Need to create a "nice" database where people can submit projects
